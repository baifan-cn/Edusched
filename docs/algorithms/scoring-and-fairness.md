# Scoring and Fairness

## Scoring model

- Weighted penalties per soft constraint
- School‑specific `WeightProfile`
- Pareto fronts for trade‑offs where appropriate

## Explainability

- Per‑assignment score breakdowns
- Aggregate fairness metrics by teacher/class

## Fairness

- Balance workload and time‑of‑day equity
- Configurable caps and distributions
