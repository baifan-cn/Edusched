# Hard and Soft Constraints

## Hard

- Teacher conflict‑free scheduling
- Room conflict‑free; feature compatibility
- Teacher availability and fixed periods respected
- Course hour totals met; student group clash‑free
- Travel time buffers across campuses

## Soft

- Preferences (teacher, class, room)
- Balance across week; spread of lessons
- Minimize idle gaps; limit consecutive lessons
- Fair workload; room utilization
- Minimize late‑day/early‑day sessions
