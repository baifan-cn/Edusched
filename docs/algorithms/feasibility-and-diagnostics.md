# Feasibility and Diagnostics

## Feasibility

- Minimal unsat cores and explanations for violated constraints
- Relaxation strategies for near‑feasible cases

## Diagnostics

- Constraint heatmaps; conflict graphs
- What‑if simulations; scenario comparisons
- Deterministic runs with seed control for reproducibility
