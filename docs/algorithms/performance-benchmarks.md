# Performance Benchmarks

## Targets

- Baselines by school size (small/medium/large)
- Timeouts and fallback strategies
- Parallelization and batching for large instances

## Methodology

- Seed datasets and reproducible runs
- CPU pinning for solver workers
- Resource isolation in Kubernetes node pools
