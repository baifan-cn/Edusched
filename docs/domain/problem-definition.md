# Problem Definition

Pre‑term timetabling for schools: assign sections to timeslots, rooms, and teachers under hard constraints and optimize soft preferences.

## Pain points

- Conflicts (teacher, room, student groups)
- Complex constraints (labs, alternating weeks, travel time)
- Manual iteration is slow; lacks diagnostics

## Objectives

- Guaranteed feasibility when possible
- Explainable optimizations and trade‑offs
- Efficient computation for large instances
