# Contributing

This repository follows MCP feedback loop and Context7 research rules in `AGENTS.md`. During Phase 0, all contributions are documentation-only.

## Principles

- Documentation is the single source of truth. Update docs before code.
- Follow mcp-feedback-enhanced: propose → request feedback → iterate.
- Perform Context7 research on any technology choice; include versions and links.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests with clear scope.

## Workflow

1. Open a draft PR early with a short proposal.
2. Cite sources (official docs, release notes) for any technical decision.
3. Request feedback and incorporate changes.
4. Keep documents consistent across sections (product, domain, backend, frontend, algorithms, ops).

## Style

- Use English as primary; include key CN terms where relevant.
- Write concise headings (H1/H2) and bullets; avoid walls of text.
- Use code fences for API examples and pseudo-structures.

## File map to edit

- `docs/README.md` — navigation
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — domain terms (CN/EN)
- Product: `docs/product/*`
- Domain: `docs/domain/*`
- Algorithms: `docs/algorithms/*`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture/*`
- Backend: `docs/backend/*`
- Frontend: `docs/frontend/*`
- Operations: `docs/operations/*`
- Adoption: `docs/adoption/*`

## Reviews

- Require at least one reviewer for significant changes.
- Validate consistency with `AGENTS.md` and cross-references.
