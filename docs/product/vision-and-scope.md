# Vision and Scope

## Vision

An intelligent, explainable timetabling platform that produces feasible and optimized schedules for entire schools while respecting constraints, preferences, and fairness.

## Goals

- Feasible first-time schedules for all classes, teachers, and rooms
- Optimization for fairness, balance, and preferences
- Fast iteration with diagnostics and explainability
- Multi-tenant SaaS with on‑prem option

## Out of scope (Phase 0)

- Real-time classroom management
- Student information system (SIS) of record
- Implementation code; this phase is docs and research only

## Open questions

- Target school types and sizes?
- Hosting preference: SaaS vs on‑prem?
- Preferred UI library (Element Plus vs Naive UI)?
- Required SIS standards/integrations?
