# Vision and Scope

## Vision

An intelligent, explainable timetabling platform that produces feasible and optimized schedules for entire schools while respecting constraints, preferences, and fairness.

## Goals

- Feasible first-time schedules for all classes, teachers, and rooms
- Optimization for fairness, balance, and preferences
- Fast iteration with diagnostics and explainability
- Multi-tenant SaaS with on‑prem option
 - 通用学校类型（含多校区）支持；私有化部署优先

## Out of scope (Phase 0)

- Real-time classroom management
- Student information system (SIS) of record
- Implementation code; this phase is docs and research only

## Open questions（已部分确认）

- Target school types and sizes?
- Hosting preference: on‑prem（已确认优先）
- Preferred UI library: Element Plus（已确认）
- Required SIS standards/integrations?
